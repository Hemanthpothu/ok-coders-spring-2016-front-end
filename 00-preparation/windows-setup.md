Windows Instructions
====

## Install software

Install the following software by downloading it at these urls:

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

This is the free text editor we will be using in class.

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/).

We will be doing all web development in Google Chrome because of its excellent developer tools.

[Git Bash](http://msysgit.github.io/)

Windows does come with a built-in command prompt, but we will be using another Terminal emulator with built-in support for git, the version control software that works with GitHub. *Do not use the built-in command prompt*. Use Git Bash.

## Optional Installs

The below is optional. The javascript we write we will run through the browser, but it can be handy to utilize the Node REPL as well.

## Install Node

Install Node.js: [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).
